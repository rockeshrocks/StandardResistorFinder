## Features
- **Nearest Match Finder**: Quickly find the closest standard resistor value.
- **Error Calculation**: Displays the deviation from the target resistance, aiding in circuit error analysis.
- **Visual Indicators**: 
  - Exact matches of resistor values for each tolerance series are highlighted in **yellow**, as shown in the example above.
  - Tolerances of Exact matches are highlighted in **green**.
